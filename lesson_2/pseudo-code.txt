DEF                                      define a method

1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

INFORMAL PSEUDO CODE

Define a method that take 2 integers and add them
  - Acess the integers from inside the method and add them up.
  - return the result of the addition 
  - call the method and get the returned value.
        
FORMAL PSEUDO CODE

DEF adder int1 and int2
  int1 + int2
END

PRINT adder int1 and int2

2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together


INFORMAL PSEUDO CODE

Given a collection of strings 

Iterate through it one by one 
 - save the first value in a var as the starting value
  - for each iteration, concatinate the subsequent value to the first value
after iterating through the collection, return the saved value.

FORMAL PSEUDO CODE

SET saved_str = first value in the collection
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator <= collection size
  SET saved_str = itself + iterator value
  iterator = iterator + 1

  PRINT saved_str
END

def concat_str(arr)
  count = 0 
  saved_str = ""
  arr.each do |word| 
    saved_str += word
  end
  saved_str 
end

p concat_str(['hi', 'how', 'are', 'you'])
